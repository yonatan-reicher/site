    Lately I've been having trouble sleeping. Every day, I do the same thing:
    <ol>
        <li> "today is the day. i'm going to bed at 22:00." </li>
        <li> "just a quick 20 minutes of x, i have 30 more minutes till sleep." </li>
        <li> it's 01:00, i just got into bed, and i can't sleep. </li>
    </ol>

<h2> blaming the whole world but me </h2>
<p>
    So yeah. A lot of both life, work, friends, social peace, technological
    progress, politics, economics, and ice cream prices have been really shitty
    in my life the last couple of years. My studies which I love a lot have
    been tiring (no in-between semester break = i have been studying for
    9 months non-stop).
</p>
<h2> blaming only me and nothin else </h2>
<p>
    But also, of course I'm depressed. I don't keep up with working out, I
    don't contact my friends, I don't go out, or take breaks, or quit, or admit
    I'm wrong. Or put the phone down when I go to sleep. <br>
    How can I blame these feelings on anyone other than me?
</p>
<h2> Learning to sleep </h2>
<p>
    Everything I said above isn't even related to sleep. I'm just tired from
    all of it. And also depressed. And I miss my loved ones I don't have time
    for. And my old self, before the world was hard.
</p>
<p>
    And all of this starts with sleep. If I go to bed on time, I can wake up
    in time, I can feel better, I can cut out time on my phone and do the
    things I enjoy with the people I enjoy. I can learn to like myself again.
</p>
<p>
    But that sounds so so hard... I don't know. I don't have the energy to do
    this. I'm too tired. I think I'll just go to bed now.
