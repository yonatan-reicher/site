    I love functional programming. I love comments. Both of them help me
    understand code and find bugs. I recently had a shower thought I really 
    liked: "Code should be local, comments should be non-local." 
</p>
<h2> Code as a Story </h2>
<p>
    Is the worst thing!! 
</p>
<p>
    "What does this mean? And how does it even relate to anything I just
      read??"
</p>
<p>
    I'm glad you asked. Code should not be a mystery. It should not have
    complicated character arcs and plot twists. Convoluted code is hard to
    read, the kind of code that to understand you need to track 15 variables
    in your head or code that sometimes reacts this way and sometimes another
    to the same inputs.
</p>
<p>
    This is what's so great about functional programming. It's not even about
    functional programming, and it's not even about side effects. It's about
    <b>letting you understand everything you need to know in a single line</b>.
    The easiest code to read is code that does not modify anything, does not
    care about anything, it just calculates an output, line by line, variable
    after variable. You don't even need to backtrack to remember what value
    is a variable holding, because it always holds the same value.
</p>
<p>
    Code should be local.
</p>
<h2> Comments as a Story </h2>
<p>
    Comments, on the other hand, should be non-local.
    What is the worst comment?
    A comment that explains something that you understand! And you know how to
    read the line in front of you. 
</p>
<p>
    The comments <em>should</em> tell a story, they should over arch the code
    and explain the big picture. All local effects of the code should only be
    written in the code itself, writing them in comments is code duplication
    and can and will lead to bugs.
</p>
<p>
    Comments should use terms and talk about big concepts.
</p>
<p>
    Comments should be non-local.
</p>
<h2> How to Tell a Story </h2>
<p>
    Every story has characters, and your characters are your data. The arcs are
    the flow of data through the code, and the plot twists are the unexpected
    parts.
</p>
<p>
    The story should be easy to follow, and split into episodic chapters.
    Break your code into self-contained modules, with iconic, recurring
    characters.
