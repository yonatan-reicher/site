This page summarizes all of my research into the Lean language.
</p>
<p>
Lean is a theorem prover and programming language. That means it's a functional
language with purity and the ability to prove facts about your code and use
them as part of the code itself!

<h2>How to Find a Lemma</h2>
<p>
When you're trying to prove something, and you're stuck on a goal you are sure
was already proved by someone, or maybe you are just looking for properties of
some definition that you are using, what are your options?
As it turns out, there are more than a couple.

        <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/doc/Init/Core.html"
        >The Docs</a>
        - here you can find documentation for all the major libraries for Lean,
        specifically Init, Std, and Mathlib.
        Most of the stuff you'll need will be in one of these (but it's hard to
        know which one).
    </li>
    <li>
        Theorem search engines - there are a couple of these, a lot actually.
        The most popular ones are:
        <ol style="padding: 0; list-style: none"> <!-- list-style: hebrew inside is also cool -->
            <li>
                <a href="https://loogle.lean-lang.org/">Loogle</a>
                - finds lemmas by a query - it's great! Much better than you
                would expect. You can find it integrated into both VSCode and
                Neovim, and in interactive mode.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://leansearch.net/">LeanSearch</a>
                - this one uses natural language to find lemmas. It's can also
                be used in interactive mode.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.moogle.ai/">Moogle</a>
                - another natural language search engine.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://leansearch.net/">Lean State Search</a>
                - this search engine is a bit different. It searches
                specifically for theorems that can be used in your current
                environment, and that align with your current goal.

        <a href="https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest//Tactic-Proofs/Tactic-Reference/"
        >The Tactic Reference</a>
        - this is a list of all built in Lean tactics. The lean language
        reference is a good resource in general, but this is the one page I
        keep coming back to.
        There is also the larger,
        <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-manual/html-multi/"
        >Mathlib Manual</a>, Mathlib's tactic reference. It contains all of
        lean's built-in tactics, and an insane amount of additional ones that
        can be used after <code>import Mathlib.Tactic</code>, and it splits
        them up to nit little categories.
