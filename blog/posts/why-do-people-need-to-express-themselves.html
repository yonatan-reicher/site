    I get why people need to express themselves. It sucks to feel that the
    people around you don't understand you. But why do people express themselves
    alone? Why make art and never show it, or talk to yourself as if you are
    in a TV show or a conversation? Are people just crazy
</p>
<p>
    Yes, but not just that. I was watching
    <a href="https://youtu.be/LKcT-aQuIFs?si=xHyCXRgYJIzX5QCH" target="_blank">
        this video about missing a removed robot voice
    </a> (it's really good, almost made me cry)
    and it made me think, why would you even care how you sound like? You are born
    with your voice, doesn't that make it the most you thing?
    The thing is, we want to sound in a way that makes people think certain
    things about us that we want them to think, like that we sound calm, or
    smart, or whatever. We want to sound like the person we want to be.
    But then a_lilian keeps speaking things and starts talking about how
    they even hear their own voice in their head. But, isn't that dumb? It is
    at the end of the day, not their voice.

<h2>Well It's not Dumb</h2>
<p>
    It's just that people also want to perceive themselves in a certain way.
    It sounds obvious when you say it like that, but yeah. People want to think
    about themselves not in the way they are, but in a different way. Is that
    bad? Isn't it just avoiding reality? No, not really. At the end of the day
    a_lilian really did sound like their microsoft-owned TTS voice, and even
    if you draw and paint and hide it from the world, you still are a painter,
    and even if you make a whole fictional D&amp;D world and never play it,
    you are a world builder and you do have characters, and they tell something
    about you. Not to no one. But to you. And that's nice.
