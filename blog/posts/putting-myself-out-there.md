It's so hard for me to open up. I always struggled with it, ever since I was
young. There are very few people who I have truly confided in, and of those
people, only a small subset have experienced it twice.

I want to change that. I don't like being closed off in my own mind, and I
want to be able to trust my family and friends with my feeling. I think I am
going to keep struggling with this for a while, but bit-by-bit I think I am
opening up. It takes time.

I want to be gentle with myself.
