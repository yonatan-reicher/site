So yeah, this is it I guess. The war between Israel and Iran has stopped,
because of a ceasefire agreement. Which Iran broke, but I guess we are just
forgetting about that. It feels really weird - all my friends at home were
convinced they were gonna die in a nuclear explosion and I was stuck overseas,
and then when I was already home, it was all just... over.

I did not feel like writing this, and that's exactly why I put it off for so
long. I'm not sure why. I feel just completely surreal. Like, nothing about this
makes sense. I feel so bad for my partner, this shitty war affected her so hard,
and it ended so anticlimactically. It caught her right in the worst time
possible, and left just about long enough for her to get severely shitty effects
on her life, her plans, her mental health, but not any second longer.

Anyway, I am glad it's over. I am mostly happy for her, now that she's free from
that stress. And I'm very glad to be home. At the end of the day, when it comes
back to it, I don't really care about where I am. I code, that's all I want to
do in life, and today I can do that anywhere, whenever I feel like. But it's so
nice to be here for the people who I care about, and to know that my family and
friends are all safe.

I am not sure how to process this. It's really weird. I hope that tomorrow I'll
sort my feelings out.

## Projects

In terms of projects, I am working on â‰¥3 exciting things:
1. I am making a 2D terminal-based minecraft clone in my spare time, and I'm
   having a blast making it. I just implemented an inventory, and I can't wait
   to see how far I can take this project. I should write a post on it.
2. A new programming language - working on compilers and programming languages
   is really fun, and this one has a special something about it for me.
3. My university project - it's a project about using static analysis to
   generate good definitions for mathematical objects in a language called Lean.
   It's a university project I'm doing with a professor, Shachar Itzhaky, and I
   did good work on it in the last few weeks. Next up in terms of that project
   is trying to compile the project Adi Harif did, to take some inspiration from
   the way he structured his code.

There are of course other things I am working on!! All kinds of things related
to courses and such. These are less exciting. Tomorrow we will see what we can
tackle. Maybe I'll even write another post.
