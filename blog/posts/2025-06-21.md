Well, tomorrow is a special day in my life, and I am still here with my family,
stuck outside the country. We have a flight back home in a couple of days, but
tomorrow I guess I'm celebrating without my girlfriend. At least I am
celebrating with my family!

Today I didn't do much (we had to move).
Tomorrow I plan to do some things:
- 9:30-10:30 - Answer emails and messages
- 10:30-12:30 - Online lecture
- 12:30-13:00 - Break
- 13:00-15:00 - Work on the Souffle project (I need to add some things about
  assumption).

Then maybe I'll go out with my family!

There's no denying that a war drains you in every possible way. I feel it
affecting me and making me emotionally stupid. I am afraid of hurting my
girlfriend. I hope I can stay good to her.
